# InvestorList

Work is as complete as I can get it for 2 hours at this point. Things I'd consider adding:

    - Tying logins better to investors
    - Adding admin logins
    - Better support for uploading large files (maybe either Liveview or a GenServer to do this?)
    - No styling outside of default Phoenix styling

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Ready to run in production? Please [check our deployment guides](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/deployment.html).
